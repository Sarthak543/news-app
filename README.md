# News Application (React.js, Bootstrap, News API)

Developed a dynamic and responsive news application using React.js, Bootstrap, and the News API.
The application fetches real-time news data from the News API and displays it in a user-friendly format.
Implemented various React components to organize the display of news content within the app.
Utilized Bootstrap for responsive design and styling, ensuring a seamless user experience across all devices.
Incorporated features such as filter functionality and infinite scroll to enhance user interaction and engagement.
The filter functionality allows users to customize their news feed based on their interests, providing a personalized news-viewing experience.
The infinite scroll feature loads additional news content as the user scrolls down, providing a continuous and seamless browsing experience.
Ensured the application adheres to modern web standards and is optimized for performance and speed.
This project demonstrates my proficiency in React.js, Bootstrap, and working with APIs, as well as my ability to create user-friendly web applications that provide real-time data.
